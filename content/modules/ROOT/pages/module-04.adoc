== Deleted file wonâ€™t delete

*Scott*: I just cant get the webteam user to run systemctl commands on
httpd through sudo!

Can you configure sudo to allow the `+webteam+` user to run
`+systemctl+` commands on the `+httpd+` service through sudo *without*
requiring a password? (This should include things like, start, stop,
restart, status, and reload)
